## About this blog

This is a blog about projects cooked up on the whim!
I personally have the problem of looking random things up. Things are learnt, and things are forgotten. Someone clever once said the best way to learn is to teach. Please be my [Rubber Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)

1. Music projects: 
   How to make music using information processing learnt in physics/music theory/
2. Coding contests
   In order to prepare for future tech company interviews, I'll write full resolution of coding contest problems, starting with Google Code Jam.
3. Games
   TBD

Now, let's [read on]({{ "/" | absolute_url }})
