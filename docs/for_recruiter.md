Hi,

Thanks for your interest, if you are from Google I am being followed by a [recruiter](mailto:richow@google.com). 
I came to play foobar from an invitation he sent. From what I understand he is responsible for recruiting for Google@Taiwan.

If however, another opportunities are available in other countries, I would be eager to know about it.

[Here]({{ "/assets/CV2019.pdf" | relative_url }}) is my CV. 
Yeah, as you can see currently I am a quantum physicist not a computer scientist, only a hobbyist. But it doesn't bother me to change tracks. 
I love programming.

Cheers!
