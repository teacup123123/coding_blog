## About this blog

This is a blog about projects cooked up on the whim!
I personally have the *habit* (pronounced as: *problem*) of looking random things up. Things are learnt, and things are forgotten. Someone clever once said the best way to learn is to teach. Please be my [Rubber Duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).

1. Music projects:
   How to make music using information processing learnt in physics/music theory. Using DAW to edit music/MV production
2. Coding contests
   In order to prepare for future tech company interviews, I'll write full resolution of coding contest problems, starting with Google Code Jam.
3. Games Development
   Unfortunately this is very very time consuming and requires multiple talents (art/music/literary). Will be doing this only when I am bored to death
   TBD

Now, let's [read on]({{ "/" | relative_url }})
