Just started learning Golang. For people who knows already quite a few programming languages here is what I recommend:
1. Set up an IDE, SDK. Since I am still in an institution with access to .edu mail adress, I downloaded JetBrain's Goland. Under Ubuntu, you only need to grab it in the app store. It is installed as a snap image. Upon creating the first project you can download an SDK in the IDE gui. And that's all! People says that Goland uses Dwelve and not gdb, avoiding some debugger issues.
2. Take the [Tour](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) of Golang. A bit intimidating with little Gopher staring at you at all times. But hey they are shy creatures that *panic* and *recover* and handles concurrency well. Cool language! And btw, it is almost as fast as C/C++.
3. Read the [document](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) which kind of explains again in more detail subjects covered in the Tour.
4. Take a look at [this](https://github.com/tmrts/go-patterns) GitHub page covering some design patterns in GO.

Let me finish this stub article with a Gopher staring down at you. Careful, he panics, he recovers, above all, he judges.
